# Instructions:
### 1. Register Yourself for Hacktoberfest 2023
###### [Link to Register](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

![Register](link)

### 2. Star and Fork This Repository
###### You can star ‚≠ê and fork üçΩÔ∏è this repository on GitHub by navigating to the top of this repository.

###### GitHub repository URLs will reference both the username associated with the owner of the repository, as well as the repository name. For example, Rafiudd is the owner of the Hacktoberfest repository, so the GitHub URL for this project is: 

[Hacktoberfest Repository](link)

###### When you‚Äôre on the main page for the repository, you‚Äôll see a button to "Star" and ‚ÄúFork‚Äù the repository on your upper right-hand side of the page, underneath your user icon.

### 3. Clone the Repository

###### To create your local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, open up a terminal window.

###### Use the `git clone` command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository.

###### This URL will be similar to the URL above but will end with `.git`. In the example above, the URL will look like this:
[Your Forked Repository URL](link)

###### Alternatively, you can copy the URL using the green ‚ÄúClone or download‚Äù button from your repository page that you just forked from the original repository page. Once you click the button, you can copy the URL by clicking the binder button next to the URL.

### 4. Create a New Branch

###### To create your branch, open your terminal window, and change your directory so that you are working in the directory of the repository. Use the actual name of the repository (i.e., Hacktoberfest 2023) to change into that directory.

###### `cd Hacktoberfest 2023`

###### Create your new branch with the `git branch` command. Name it descriptively so that others working on the project understand what you are working on.

###### `git branch new-branch`

###### Switch to the new branch to make sure you are working on that branch:

###### `git checkout new-branch`

###### `git add -A` or `git add .`

###### `git commit -m "Updated README.md"`

###### Push to your local repository:
###### `git push origin new-branch`

### 5. Create a Pull Request

###### At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.

###### Navigate to your forked repository and press the ‚ÄúNew pull request‚Äù button
